# Expo Camera Preview Corruption Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo Camera preview can disappear or become corrupted after layout changes or re-renders.  The issue is particularly prominent when the camera is used within components that manage state or involve animations.  The `buggy.js` file shows the problematic implementation, while `fixed.js` offers a solution.

## Bug Description

The Expo Camera component's preview might disappear or display incorrectly after screen updates or interactions, especially when integrated with dynamic UI elements. This seemingly random behavior can hinder the user experience.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing the Camera component's lifecycle and preventing unnecessary re-renders or layout changes that might interfere with the preview. The `fixed.js` file provides a refined approach that addresses this instability.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the Expo development server.
4. Observe the Camera preview behavior; interactions or UI updates might lead to corruption or disappearance.

## Additional Notes

This issue highlights the importance of efficient component design and lifecycle management when integrating the Expo Camera component into more complex applications.
